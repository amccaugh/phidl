# PHIDL
GDS scripting for Python that's intuitive, fast, and powerful.

- [**Installation / requirements**](#installation--requirements)
- [**Tutorial + examples**](https://phidl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) (or [try an interactive notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/amccaugh/phidl/master?filepath=phidl_tutorial_example.ipynb))
- [**Geometry library + function documentation**](https://phidl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/geometry_reference.html)
- [Changelog](https://github.com/amccaugh/phidl/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) (latest update 1.7.2 on July 3, 2024)
  -  New KLayout-based boolean/offset/outline functions!  These are under the name `pg.kl_boolean()`, `pg.kl_offset`, `pg.kl_outline()`, `pg.kl_invert()`.  They utilize the excellent KLayout tile processor, which allows breaking down & parallelizing these operations--in a nutshell, these operations should be much, much faster, and they also are more robust than the gdspy/clipper implementation. To use these new functions, you must first `pip install klayout`
  - Path.interpolate() now allows easy placement of objects alongside a path (e.g. for placing vias).  See [the tutorial](https://phidl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/waveguides.html#Interpolating-/-placing-objects-along-a-path) for more information

# About PHIDL

*fiddle (verb) - /Ëˆfidl/ - to make minor manual movements, especially to adjust something*

PHIDL is an open-source GDS-based CAD tool for Python that significantly extends the excellent [gdspy](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy).  The base installation includes a large library of simple shapes (e.g. rectangles, circles), photonic structures (e.g. sine curve waveguides), and superconducting nanowire shapes (e.g. single photon detectors) that are fully parameterized. It also has a built-in quick-plotting function based on matplotlib (or Qt) that allows you view the state of any GDS object, useful when scripting geometry-making functions. It also has a [__geometry library reference__](https://phidl.readthedocs.io/) and a set of [__very thorough tutorials__](https://phidl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) that will walk you through the process of getting acquainted with PHIDL.

The goal is to bring the usability of Illustrator / Inkscape drawing programs to the GDS scripting world. Like Python itself, it aims to be readable, and intuitive.  For instance, when building a geometry you don't have to worry about what the exact coordinates are anymore. If you want to separate two ellipses in the x direction by 5 units, you can do things like this:

`ellipse1.xmin = ellipse2.xmax + 5`

or if you want to move then rotate one ellipse by 45 degrees you can do

`ellipse2.move([1,7]).rotate(45)`

There's a few dozen shortcuts like this that make life easier built into PHIDL--they're simple, but they make a world of difference when you just want to e.g. space a ring resonator some distance from a waveguide without having to track each and every coordinate of the shape.

There's also a "port" functionality that allows you to snap together geometry like Legos without caring about where exactly the absolute coordinates of either geometry is.  For instance, connecting the above misaligned rectangles is a two-line command:

It also allows you to do things like add text and create smooth or straight routing curves between "ports" of different devices, convenient for making electrical or optical connections:

Other useful functionality available are standard operations like booleans:

 and less standard ones like creating outlines. A whole layout can be outlined directly in the GDS without requiring you to use Beamer (useful for positive-tone resist structures):

`pg.outline(D, distance = 0.7, layer = 4)`

The geometry library also has useful resolution test-structures built into it, for instance

```
pg.litho_calipers(num_notches = 7, offset_per_notch = 0.1)
pg.litho_steps(line_widths = [1,2,4,8,16])
pg.litho_star(num_lines = 16, line_width = 3)
```

![phidl example image](https://amccaugh.github.io/phidl/readme_7.png)

There are also handy functions to help pack shapes into as small an area as possible:

```
pg.packer(D_list, spacing = 1.25, aspect_ratio = (2,1))
```
