# PHIDL TUTORIAL START
#==============================================================================
#==============================================================================
#==============================================================================


#==============================================================================
# We'll start by assuming we have a function waveguide() which already exists
# and makes us a simple waveguide rectangle.  Many functions like this
# exist in the phidl.geometry library and are ready-for-use.  We write this
# one out fully just so it's explicitly clear what's happening
#==============================================================================

def waveguide(width = 10, height = 1):
    WG = Device('waveguide')
    WG.add_polygon( [(0, 0), (width, 0), (width, height), (0, height)] )
    WG.add_port(name = 'wgport1', midpoint = [0,height/2], width = height, orientation = 180)
    WG.add_port(name = 'wgport2', midpoint = [width,height/2], width = height, orientation = 0)
    return WG


#==============================================================================
# Create a blank device
#==============================================================================
# Let's create a new device ``D`` which will act as a blank canvas (D can be
# thought of as a blank GDS cell with some special features). Note that when we
# make a Device, we usually assign it a variable name with a capital letter
D = Device('MultiWaveguide')

# Now say we want to add a few waveguides to to our "Device" D.
# First we create the waveguides.  As you can see from the waveguide() function
# definition, the waveguide() function creates another Device ("WG").
# This can be thought of as the waveguide() function creating another GDS cell,
# only this one has some geometry inside it.
#
# Let's create two of these Devices by calling the waveguide() function
WG1 = waveguide(width=10, height = 1)
WG2 = waveguide(width=12, height = 2)

# Now we've made two waveguides Device WG1 and WG2, and we have a blank
# device D. We can add references from the devices WG1 and WG2 to our blank
# device byz using the add_ref() function.
# After adding WG1, we see that the add_ref() function returns a handle to our
# reference, which we will label with lowercase letters wg1 and wg2.  This
# handle will be useful later when we want to move wg1 and wg2 around in D.
wg1 = D.add_ref(WG1)  # Using the function add_ref()
wg2 = D << WG2        # Using the << operator which is identical to add_ref()

# Alternatively, we can do this all on one line
wg3 = D.add_ref(waveguide(width=14, height = 3))

qp(D) # quickplot it!



#==============================================================================
# Creating polygons
#==============================================================================
# Create and add a polygon from separate lists of x points and y points
# e.g. [(x1, x2, x3, ...), (y1, y2, y3, ...)]
poly1 = D.add_polygon( [(8,6,7,9), (6,8,9,5)], layer = 0)

# Alternatively, create and add a polygon from a list of points
# e.g. [(x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), ...] using the same function
poly2 = D.add_polygon( [(-5, 3), (-4, 4), (-4, 6), (-8, 6)], layer = 1)

# As a third option, use functions from the built-in geometry library
# (more examples below in section "Using the built-in geometry library")
# and a listing is available at http://phidl.readthedocs.io/ )
D << pg.ellipse(radii = (3,1.5), layer = 1).move([10,-4])
D << pg.cross(length = 3, width = 0.2, layer = 0).move([10,-8])
D << pg.rectangle(size = (4,2), layer = 3).move([-10,-5])

#==============================================================================
# Manipulating geometry 1 - Basic movement and rotation
#==============================================================================
# There are several actions we can take to move and rotate the geometry.  These
# actions include movement, rotation, and reflection.

wg1.move([10,4]) # Shift the second waveguide we created over by dx = 10, dy = 4
wg2.move(origin = [1,1], destination = [2,2]) # Shift the second waveguide over by dx = 1, dy = 1
wg3.move([1,1], [5,5], axis = 'y') # Shift the third waveguide over by dx = 0, dy = 4 (motion only along y-axis)
poly1.movey(4) # Same as specifying axis='y' in the move() command
poly2.movex(4) # Same as specifying axis='x'' in the move() command
wg3.movex(30,40) # Moves "from" x=30 "to" x=40 (e.g. shifts wg3 by +10 in the x-direction)

wg1.rotate(45) # Rotate the first waveguide by 45 degrees around (0,0)
wg2.rotate(30, center = [1,1]) # Rotate the second waveguide by 30 degrees around (1,1)

wg1.mirror(p1 = [1,1], p2 = [1,3]) # Reflects wg3 across the line formed by p1 and p2



#==============================================================================
# Manipulating geometry 2 - Properties
#==============================================================================
# Each Device and DeviceReference object has several properties which can be used to learn
# information about the object (for instance where it's center coordinate is).  Several
# of these properties can actually be used to move the geometry by assigning them
# new values

print(wg1.bbox) # Will print the bounding box of wg1 in terms of [(xmin, ymin), (xmax, ymax)]
print(wg1.xsize) # Will print the width of wg1 in the x dimension
print(wg1.ysize) # Will print the height of wg1 in the y dimension

print(wg1.center) # Gives you the center coordinate of its bounding box
wg1.center = [4,4] # Shift wg1 such that the center coordinate of its bounding box is at (4,4)

print(wg2.xmax) # Gives you the rightmost (+x) edge of the wg2 bounding box
wg2.xmax = 25 # Moves wg2 such that it's rightmost edge is at x = 25

wg2.y = 5 # Sets the y-coordingate of the center of the shape's bounding box

wg3.ymin # Gives you the bottommost (-y) edge of the wg3 bounding box
wg3.ymin = -14 # Moves wg3 such that it's bottommost edge is at y = -14


qp(D) # quickplot it!


#==============================================================================
# Manipulating geometry 3 - Smarter movement with ports
#==============================================================================
# All the waveguides we made have two ports: 'wgport1' and 'wgport2'  We can
# use these names in place of (x,y) pairs.  For instance, if we want to move
# wg1 such that its port 'wgport1' rests on the origin, we do:
wg1.move(origin = wg1.ports['wgport1'], destination = [0,0])
# Alternatively, we can use the Port object itself in the same manner.  We can
# access the Port objects for any Device (or DeviceReference) by calling device.ports,
# --which returns a Python dictionary--and accessing its value with the key
wg3.move(origin = wg3.ports['wgport1'], destination = [0,0])
# We can even move one port to another
wg2.move(origin = wg2.ports['wgport1'], destination = wg3.ports['wgport2'])
# Several functions beyond just move() can take Ports as inputs
wg1.rotate(angle = -60, center = wg1.ports['wgport2'])
wg3.mirror(p1 = wg3.ports['wgport1'].midpoint, p2 = wg3.ports['wgport1'].midpoint + np.array([1,0]))

qp(D) # quickplot it!



#==============================================================================
# Manipulating geometry 4 - Chaining commands
#==============================================================================
# Many of the functions in Device return the object they manipulate.  We can use
# this to chain commands in a single line. For instance these two expressions:
wg1.rotate(angle = 15, center = [0,0])
wg1.move([10,20])

# ...are equivalent to this single-line expression
wg1.rotate(angle = 15, center = [0,0]).move([10,20])



#==============================================================================
# Connecting devices with connect()
#==============================================================================
# The connect command allows us to connect DeviceReference ports together like
# Lego blocks.  There is an optional parameter called ``overlap`` which is
# useful if you have shapes you want to intersect with some overlap (or with a
# negative number, separate the ports).
wg1.connect(port = 'wgport1', destination = wg2.ports['wgport2'])
wg3.connect(port = 'wgport2', destination = wg2.ports['wgport1'], overlap = -1)

qp(D) # quickplot it!



#==============================================================================
# Adding ports
#==============================================================================
# Although our waveguides wg1/wg2/wg3 have ports, they're only references
# of the device ``D`` we're working in, and D itself does not -- it only draws
# the subports (ports of wg1, wg2, wg3) as a convenience.  We need to add ports
# that we specifically want in our new device ``D``. add_port() can take a
# port argument which allows you to pass it an underlying reference port to
# copy. You can also rename the port if you desire:
p1 = D.add_port(port = wg1.ports['wgport2'], name = 1)
p2 = D.add_port(port = wg3.ports['wgport1'], name = 2)

# Optionally, let's assign some information to these ports.  Every Port has
# a Port.info dictionary which can be used to store information about that port
p1.info['is_useful'] = True
p2.info['is_useful'] = False


qp(D) # quickplot it!



#==============================================================================
# Taking things a level higher
#==============================================================================
# Now that we have our device ``D`` which is a multi-waveguide device, we
# can add references to that device in a new blank canvas we'll call ``D2``.
# We'll add two copies of ``D`` to D2, and shift one so we can see them both
D2 = Device('MultiMultiWaveguide')
mwg1 = D2.add_ref(D)
mwg2 = D2.add_ref(D)
mwg2.move(destination = [10,10])

qp(D2) # quickplot it!

# Like before, let's connect mwg1 and mwg2 together then offset them slightly
mwg1.connect(port = 1, destination = mwg2.ports[2])
mwg2.move(destination = [30,30])

qp(D2) # quickplot it!


# Since the references mwg1 and mwg2 only point to the device ``D``, any
# changes that we make to the original ``D`` will be reflected in ``D2``

poly2.x += 40

qp(D2) # quickplot it!


#==============================================================================
# Routing
#==============================================================================
# Routing allows us to connect two ports which face each other with a smooth
# polygon.  Since we connected our two
D2.add_ref( pr.route_basic(port1 = mwg1.ports[1], port2 = mwg2.ports[2],
            path_type = 'sine', width_type = 'straight') )
qp(D2)



#==============================================================================
# Adding text
#==============================================================================
# The function text() creates a Device, just like waveguide.  Use it and
# manipulate it like any other Device
t = D2.add_ref( pg.text('Hello\nworld!', size = 10, justify = 'center'))
t.move([0,40]).rotate(45)
qp(D2)

# Using the built-in geometry library (phidl.geometry)
#==============================================================================
# Usually at the beginning of a phidl file we import the phidl.geometry module
# as ``pg``, like this:
import phidl.geometry as pg

# The ``pg`` module contains dozens of premade shapes and structures, ranging
# from simple ones like ellipses to complex photonic structures.  Let's create
# a few simple structures and plot them
D = Device()

g2 = D.add_ref(G2)
g3 = D.add_ref(G3)
g1.xmin = g2.xmax + 5

# Let's save this file so we can practice importing it in the next step
D.write_gds('MyNewGDS.gds')


#==============================================================================
# Premade geometry: Lithography shapes
#==============================================================================
# PHIDL comes with a set of handy functions for creating standard lithographic
# test structures, such as calipers (for detecting fabrication-layer-offsets),
# stars, and positive + negative-tone steps
D = Device()

#==============================================================================
# Labeling
#==============================================================================
# We can also label (annotate) our devices, in order to record information
# directly into the final GDS file without putting any extra geometry onto any

# This label will display in a GDS viewer, but will not be rendered
# or printed like the polygons created by the text()

#==============================================================================
# Packing shapes into a rectangular bin
#==============================================================================

# The `pg.packer()` function is able to pack geometries together into
# rectangular bins. If a `max_size` is specified, the function will create as
# many bins as is necessary to pack all the geometries and then return a list
# of the filled-bin Devices.

# Here we generate several random shapes then compress them together
# automatically. We allow the bin to be as large as needed to fit all the
# Devices by specifying `max_size = (None, None)`.  By setting `aspect_ratio =
# (2,1)`, we specify the rectangular bin it tries to pack them into should be
# twice as wide as it is tall:

np.random.seed(5)
D_list = [pg.ellipse(radii = np.random.rand(2)*n+2) for n in range(50)]
D_list += [pg.rectangle(size = np.random.rand(2)*n+2) for n in range(50)]

D_packed_list = pg.packer(
        D_list,                 # Must be a list or tuple of Devices
        spacing = 1.25,         # Minimum distance between adjacent shapes
        aspect_ratio = (2,1),   # (width, height) ratio of the rectangular bin
        max_size = (None,None), # Limits the size into which the shapes will be packed
        density = 1.05,          # Values closer to 1 pack tighter but require more computation
        sort_by_area = True,    # Pre-sorts the shapes by area
        verbose = False,
        )
D = D_packed_list[0] # Only one bin was created, so we plot that
qp(D) # quickplot the geometry

# Say we need to pack many shapes into multiple 500x500 unit die. If we set
# `max_size = (500,500)` the shapes will be packed into as many 500x500 unit
# die as required to fit them all:

np.random.seed(1)
D_list = [pg.ellipse(radii = np.random.rand(2)*n+2) for n in range(120)]
D_list += [pg.rectangle(size = np.random.rand(2)*n+2) for n in range(120)]

D_packed_list = pg.packer(
        D_list,                 # Must be a list or tuple of Devices
        spacing = 4,         # Minimum distance between adjacent shapes
        aspect_ratio = (1,1),   # Shape of the box
        max_size = (500,500),   # Limits the size into which the shapes will be packed
        density = 1.05,         # Values closer to 1 pack tighter but require more computation
        sort_by_area = True,    # Pre-sorts the shapes by area
        verbose = False,
        )

# Put all packed bins into a single device and spread them out with distribute()
F = Device()
[F.add_ref(D) for D in D_packed_list]
F.distribute(elements = 'all', direction = 'x', spacing = 100, separation = True)
qp(F)

# Note that the packing problem is an NP-complete problem, so `pg.packer()`
# may be slow if there are more than a few hundred Devices to pack (in that
# case, try pre-packing a few dozen at a time then packing the resulting
# bins). Requires the `rectpack` python package.



#==============================================================================
# Distributing shapes
#==============================================================================
# The `distribute()` function allows you to space out elements within a Device
# evenly in the x or y direction.  It is meant to duplicate the distribute
# functionality present in Inkscape / Adobe Illustrator

# Say we start out with a few random-sized rectangles we want to space out
# and we want to guarantee some distance between the objects.  By
# setting `separation = True` we move each object such that there is `spacing`
# distance between them:

D = Device()
# Create differents-sized rectangles and add them to D
[D.add_ref(pg.rectangle(size = [n*15+20,n*15+20]).move((n,n*4))) for n in [0,2,3,1,2]]
# Distribute all the rectangles in D along the x-direction with a separation of 5
D.distribute(elements = 'all',   # either 'all' or a list of objects
             direction = 'x',    # 'x' or 'y'
             spacing = 5,
             separation = True)

# Alternatively, we can spread them out on a fixed grid by setting `separation
# = False`. Here we align the left edge (`edge = 'min'`) of each object along
# a grid spacing of 100:

D = Device()
[D.add_ref(pg.rectangle(size = [n*15+20,n*15+20]).move((n,n*4))) for n in [0,2,3,1,2]]
D.distribute(elements = 'all', direction = 'x', spacing = 100, separation = False,
             edge = 'xmin') # edge must be either 'xmin', 'xmax', 'x', 'ymin', 'ymax', or 'y'

qp(D) # quickplot the geometry

# The alignment can also be done along the right edge as well by setting 
# `edge = 'max'`, or along the center by setting `edge = 'center'`



#==============================================================================
# Aligning shapes
#==============================================================================

# The `align()` function allows you to elements within a Device horizontally
# or vertically.  It is meant to duplicate the alignment functionality present
# in Inkscape / Adobe Illustrator:

# Say we `distribute()` a few objects, but they're all misaligned.
# we can use the `align()` function to align their top edges (`alignment = 'ymax'):

D = Device()
# Create differents-sized rectangles and add them to D then distribute them
[D.add_ref(pg.rectangle(size = [n*15+20,n*15+20]).move((n,n*4))) for n in [0,2,3,1,2]]
D.distribute(elements = 'all', direction = 'x', spacing = 5, separation = True)

# Align top edges
D.align(elements = 'all', alignment = 'ymax')

qp(D) # quickplot the geometry


# or align their centers (`alignment = 'y'):
D = Device()
# Create differents-sized rectangles and add them to D then distribute them
[D.add_ref(pg.rectangle(size = [n*15+20,n*15+20]).move((n,n*4))) for n in [0,2,3,1,2]]
D.distribute(elements = 'all', direction = 'x', spacing = 5, separation = True)

# Align top edges
D.align(elements = 'all', alignment = 'y')

qp(D) # quickplot the geometry

# other valid alignment options include `'xmin', 'x', 'xmax', 'ymin', 'y', and 'ymax'`


#==============================================================================
# Advanced: Acquiring port information
#==============================================================================
# In some cases, you may want to gather information about the ports in your
# Device.  You can do that using the get_ports(depth) function, which will
# return ports within the device

# This is empty as D2 does not have any ports of its own, only ports within
# its references
top_level_ports = D2.get_ports(depth = 0)

# This gets the ports from the refrences we added to D2 (mwg1 and mwg2)
first_level_ports = D2.get_ports(depth = 1)

# This gets all the ports from every level
all_ports = D2.get_ports(depth = None)

# We can then filter to find the locations of all ports we defined as "useful":
for p in all_ports:
    if 'is_useful' in p.info and p.info['is_useful'] is True:
        print(str(p) + ' is useful')



#==============================================================================
# Advanced: Using CellArray
#==============================================================================
# In GDS, there's a type of structure called a "CellArray" which takes a cell
# and repeats it NxM times on a fixed grid spacing.  For convenience, PHIDL
# includes this functionality with the add_array() function.  Note that
# CellArrays are not compatible with ports (since there is no way to 
# access/modify individual elements in a GDS cellarray)

D = Device()
R = pg.rectangle([30,20])
a = D.add_array(R, columns = 7, rows = 5,  spacing = (31, 21))
# bbox gets the bounding box of the whole array
a.bbox.tolist() == [[0.0, 0.0], [216.0, 104.0]] 
qp(D)




#==============================================================================
# Importing GDS files
#==============================================================================
# The phidl.geometry module is responsible for generating premade Devices.
# This includes imported geometry from other GDS files too.  When you import
# a GDS, you specify which layers you want, and it will import those layers
# as a new Device.  The new device can then be manipulated like any other.

# Let's import the GDS we just saved in the previous step.  Although generally
# you must specify which cell in the GDS file you want to import using the
# argument `cellname`, if the GDS file has only one top-level cell (like our
# MyLayerSetPreview.gds file does), the cellname argument can be left out and
# import_gds() will import that top-level cell.

# Let's first just import the entire GDS as-is
E = pg.import_gds(filename = 'MyNewGDS.gds')
qp(E)


# Similarly, we can import the same file but flatten the entire cell
# heirarchy
E2 = pg.import_gds(filename = 'MyNewGDS.gds', flatten = True)


#==============================================================================
# Using Layers
#==============================================================================
# Let's make a new blank device DL and add some text to it, but this time on
# different layers
DL = Device()

# You can specify any layer in one of three ways:
# 1) as a single number 0-255 representing the gds layer number, e.g. layer = 1
# where the gds layer datatype will be automatically set to zero
DL.add_ref( pg.text('Layer1', size = 10, layer = 1) )


# 2) as a 2-element list [0,1] or tuple (0,1) representing the gds layer
# number (0-255) and gds layer datatype (0-255)
DL.add_ref( pg.text('Layer2', size = 10, layer = [2,5]) ).movey(-20)

# 3) as a Layer object
my_gold_layer = Layer(gds_layer = 3, gds_datatype = 0, name = 'goldpads',
                      color = (0.1,.5,.9), description = 'Gold pads liftoff')
my_unused_layer = Layer(240,1) # Creates a Layer for GDS layer 240 (dataype 1)
DL.add_ref( pg.text('Layer3', size = 10, layer = my_gold_layer) ).movey(-40)


#==============================================================================
# Advanced layers: Generating geometry on multiple layers at once
#==============================================================================
# Say we want to create the same ellipse on several different layers.  We can
# do that by using a Python `set` of layers.  So if we want to add it to three
# layers, say GDS layer 1 datatype 0, GDS layer 3 datatype 5, and GDS layer 7
# datatype 8:

# Note each element of the set must be a valid layer input by itself
my_layers = {1, (3,5), (7,8)}
# When you apply the set to add_polygon, you get a list of the returned polygons

# Advanced layers: Containing multiple Layers in a LayerSet object
#==============================================================================
# What you can also do is make a LayerSet, which lets you
# conveniently call each Layer object just by its name.  You can also specify
# the layer color using an RGB triplet e.g (0.1, 0.4, 0.2), an HTML hex color
# (e.g. #a31df4), or a CSS3 color name (e.g. 'gold' or 'lightblue'
# see http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp )
# The 'alpha' argument also lets you specify how transparent that layer should
# look when using quickplot (has no effect on the written GDS file)

ls = LayerSet() # Create a blank LayerSet
ls.add_layer(name = 'au', gds_layer = 4, gds_datatype = 0,  description = 'Gold wiring', color = 'goldenrod')

ls.add_layer('nb_etch', 6, 0, color = 'lightblue', alpha = 0.2)

# Now that our layers are defined, we can call them from the LayerSet in the same way
# we would from a dictionary, where the name becomes the key:

text3 = DL.add_ref( pg.text('Nb Etch layer', size = 10, layer = ls['nb_etch']) ).movey(-90).movex(5)


# We can additionally use a LayerSet to add the same structure to several
# layers at once by passing the whole layerset to the layer argument
text4 = DL.add_ref( pg.text('All layers', size = 10, layer = ls) ).movey(-120)


qp(DL)

# If we want to examine any single layer, we can call them by their names,

# We can quickly preview our color scheme using the LayerSet.preview()
# function as well.
P = pg.preview_layerset(ls)

#==============================================================================
# Removing  layers
#==============================================================================
# Now say we only wanted to get layers 4 and 5 from an imported.  We can remove
# the unwanted layers using the remove_layers() function

#==============================================================================
# Remapping layers
#==============================================================================
# Let's import our layerset preview again
D = pg.import_gds(filename = 'MyLayerSetPreview.gds')

# We can use the remap_layers() function to map layers arbitrarily. Say we
# wanted to move shapes on layer 5 to layer 99, and layer 6 to layer 77
# but leave the other layers alone.  We can map layers 5->99, 6->77, and leave
# any other layers alone by passing a dict to the `layermap` argument

#==============================================================================
# Constructing a Device from set of parameters (dictionary or config file)
#==============================================================================
# Say we want to make a more complicated waveguide which requires more

# function.

def complicated_waveguide(width = 10, height = 1, x = 10, y = 25, rotation = 15):

# We can either create the complicated_waveguide() the normal way
C1 = complicated_waveguide(width = 14, height = 1, x = 15, y = 20, rotation = 0)

# Or we can pass the complicated_waveguide function and our parameter list
# to the Device() function which will generate it for us using our config
C2 = make_device(complicated_waveguide, config = cwg_parameters)

# We can also override any parameter we like in our dictionary of parameters
# by adding keyword arguments -- the input dictionary is untouched afterwards
C3 = make_device(complicated_waveguide, config = cwg_parameters, width = 500, rotation = 35)

# The most useful implementation of this is to keep a standard set of
# parameters and then override certain parameters each iteration of the for
# loop. Say we want to use our standard cwg_parameters but change the height
#  each time:
D = Device()
for h in [0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4]:
    C4 = make_device(complicated_waveguide, config = cwg_parameters, height = h)

#==============================================================================
# Keeping track of geometry using the "alias" functionality
#==============================================================================
# It can be useful to keep track of our DeviceReferences without
# needing to assign the reference to a variable.  We can do this by specifying
# an 'alias' for the added DeviceReference.

# For instance, if we wanted to keep track of a circle references twice in D,
# we might normally assign each reference to a separate variable:
D = Device()
C = pg.circle()
c1 = D.add_ref(C)   # Add first reference
c2 = D.add_ref(C)   # Add second reference
c2.x += 15          # Move the second circle over by 15
qp(c2)
qp(D)


# But rather than cluttering up the list of variables with these refernces,
# we can instead create 'aliases' to each reference, and call them directly
# out of D like you would with a Python dictionary.  For example:
D = Device()
C = pg.circle()
D.add_ref(C, alias = 'circle1') # Add first reference
D['circle2'] = D.add_ref(C) # Add second reference in a different style
D['circle3'] = D << C # Add third reference in yet another way!

# Even though we created these references/aliases three different ways,
# they all behave the same way:
D['circle1'].x += 5            # Moving the second circle over by 5
D['circle2'].x += 10            # Moving the second circle over by 10
D['circle3'].x += 15            # Moving the second circle over by 15
# Note that at this point, D['circle2'] is equivalent to the variable c2
# we made above
qp(D['circle2'], label_aliases = True)
qp(D, label_aliases = True)

# You can also access the list of aliases for your Device whenever you want
# to by accessing Device.aliases, which is a Python dictionary.  For example:
print(D.aliases)
print(D.aliases.keys())


#==============================================================================
# Flattening a Device
#==============================================================================
# Sometimes you want to remove cell structure from a Device while keeping all
# of the shapes/polygons intact and in place.  The D.flatten() keeps all the
# polygons in D, but removes all the underlying references it's attached to.
# Also, if you specify the `single_layer` argument it will move all of the
# polyons to that single layer

D = Device()

#==============================================================================
# Decluttering - Absorbing references into a main Device
#==============================================================================
# Say you had a Device "D" which contains several references named
# "ref1", "ref2", "ref_cluttered".  Suppose the reference "ref_cluttered" is
# cluttering up your cell hierarchy when you're viewing it in your favorite
# GDS viewer.  The D.absorb() function can eliminate the "ref_cluttered"
# hierarchy while maintaining the geometry -- it strips out all the polygons
# from "ref_cluttered" and adds them directly to "D", then removes
# the reference "ref_cluttered" from D entirely

D = Device()
E1 = pg.ellipse(layer = 1)
E2 = pg.ellipse(layer = 2)
 # The SNSPD has a lot of underlying hierarchy
S1 = pg.snspd(layer = 3)

#==============================================================================
# Copying a Device
#==============================================================================
# Since copying a Device involves creating a new geometry, you can copy a
# Device D using the pg.copy(D) or pg.deepcopy(D) function.  pg.copy(D)
# maintains the underlying connections to other Device, so that newly-created
# Device uses the same references as the original device.  Conversely,
# pg.deepcopy() creates completely new copies of every underlying polygon and
# reference, so that the newly-created Device shares no dependencies/references
# with the original Device.  These functions are especially useful if
# you want to flatten a geometry without damaging the structure of the
# original Device.

D = Device()
E1 = pg.ellipse(layer = 1)
E2 = pg.rectangle(layer = 2)
D.add_ref(E1)
D.add_ref(E2).movex(15)

# Observe that if we add geometry to D now, D_copied is unaffected
D.add_ref(pg.circle())
D.rotate(45)
qp(D_copied)

# However, note that if we now modify the underlying Devices (which
# were referenced in D, and whose references were copied to D_copied), both
# the original D and D_copied are affected:
E1.add_polygon([[10,20,35], [1,60,40]], layer = 3)
qp(D_copied)

# If instead we use pg.deepcopy(), all of the underlying references are copied
# and used in the new D_deepcopied device.  So if we change one of the old
# references, the new D_deepcopied doesn't get affected
D = Device()
E1 = pg.ellipse(layer = 1)
E2 = pg.rectangle(layer = 2)
D.add_ref(E1)

# As before, if we add geometry to D now, D_deepcopied is unaffected

#==============================================================================
# Extracting layers
#==============================================================================
# Say you want to grab all the polygons of a single layer from your Device. You
# can do this using the pg.extract() function, which will create a new Device
# with all of the polygons from D.  Note that the Device created from this

# Making boolean shapes
#==============================================================================
# If you want to subtract one shape from another, merge two shapes, or
# perform an XOR on them, you can do that with the pg.boolean() function.
# the ``operation`` argument should be {not, and, or, xor, 'A-B', 'B-A', 'A+B'}.
# Note that 'A+B' is equivalent to 'or', 'A-B' is equivalent to 'not', and

#==============================================================================
# Joining (Unioning) shapes together
#==============================================================================
# If you have several polygons which form a single compound shape and you want

#==============================================================================
# Comparing two Devices
#==============================================================================
# Sometimes you want to be able to test whether two Devices are identical or
# not (similar to the "diff" of a text file).  You can perform this comparison
# by using the pg.xor_diff(A, B) function.  It will perform a layer-by-layer

# Now let's compare two identical Devices

# Removing geometry
